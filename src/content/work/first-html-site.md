  My humble beginnings as a web developer — hand-coded in pure HTML, no frameworks, just curiosity and a Cumberland sausage.

> Everyone starts somewhere — and this is where I began.

This was the very first webpage I ever built — no libraries, no templates, no frameworks. Just a blank text editor, a `<table>`, and a dream. It was my entry point into the world of web development, where I learned how markup languages work, how to structure a page, and most importantly, how fun and creative building for the web can be.

I wrote the whole thing in raw HTML: headings, images, tables, and even a few links (including one to a very important **Cumberland sausage review**). I had no idea what semantic HTML was yet, but I was hooked from the moment I hit `save` and opened the file in a browser.

### Features

- My first `<table>` layout (it was the style at the time)
- Custom HTML structure for work history, skills, and hobbies
- Carefully crafted `<ul>` list explaining my day, including sausage review sub-items
- A proud “⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐” rating in Pokémon training

---

### What I Learned

- How browsers interpret basic HTML
- That writing web pages by hand is oddly satisfying
- The thrill of seeing something I created appear in a browser
- That even the simplest project can spark a career change

### Legacy

I still look back on this site with a lot of affection — not because it's technically impressive, but because it was the first time I realized I could make things for the web. It’s where everything started.
