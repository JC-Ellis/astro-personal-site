> My first backend project in Java â€” a learning exercise in Spring Boot and building production-ready APIs.

This API project is currently in development as part of my self-led exploration of **Java** and the **Spring Boot** ecosystem, based on the **Codecademy Java & Spring Boot track**. It aims to serve as a structured, RESTful backend for managing news content â€” including articles, users, and comments.

Though the project is still in progress, it already demonstrates core concepts like MVC architecture, JPA-based database relationships, and clean controller logic. My focus has been on writing scalable code, ensuring clear API responses, and learning best practices around Java backend development.

---

#### Key Goals

- RESTful API covering full CRUD operations
- Clean separation of concerns (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository)
- Comprehensive error handling with clear status codes
- Secure access and role-based user permissions (in a later phase)

---

#### What I'm Learning

This project has been a hands-on way to:
- Understand how Spring Boot automates backend architecture
- Work with Java annotations, dependency injection, and database bindings
- Design APIs from scratch with RESTful conventions
- Plan for extensibility, including auth and frontend integration

---

#### Tech Stack

- **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**
- PostgreSQL with JPA and Hibernate
- Gradle project structure with environment-based configs
- Swagger for documentation (planned)
- Local testing with Postman and JUnit
